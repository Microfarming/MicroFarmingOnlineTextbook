            <h3>General Recommendations</h3>
            <p><strong>Transplanting:</strong> Should be done early in the morning, finishing before 9 AM, or in the afternoon, starting after 3:30 PM.</p>
            <p><strong>Loss Review:</strong> Check for losses in the first 5 days to replace them.</p>
            <p><strong>Watering:</strong> For the first 2 weeks, water 3 times a day to reach field capacity (adequate moisture). From the 3rd week, water twice a day, monitoring the moisture to maintain uniform moisture. During the fruiting stage, water 3 times a day again to maintain uniform moisture.</p>
            <p><strong>Pest and Disease Monitoring:</strong> Daily monitoring to identify and report pests and diseases, as open field cultivation is prone to be affected at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Drip Tape Review:</strong> Ensure drip tapes are in the correct position, with the dripper facing up and checking for leaks.</p>
            <p><strong>Mulch Plastic Review:</strong> Ensure mulch plastic is tight enough to avoid hot air currents that can damage the roots internally.</p>
            <p><strong>Lettuce and Cabbage Harvesting:</strong> Activate watering 1 hour before harvesting to prevent crop dehydration.</p>
            <p><strong>Basket Use:</strong> Do not use field baskets for final product shipment.</p>
            <p><strong>Traceability Control:</strong> Keep records to demonstrate traceability, including germination date, transplant date, products applied for any disease or pest, harvest start and end dates, visit records, labeling of gardens with crop names and transplant dates.</p>
            <p><strong>Climate Change Adaptation:</strong> Construction of special roofs for plant protection against rain and high temperatures (optional based on monetary capital for investment). Estimated time for 120 linear meters of any crop is approximately 24 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical Control for Pests:</strong> Use physical controllers such as natural and artificial barriers. Estimated time for 120 linear meters of any crop is approximately 24 hours.</p>
